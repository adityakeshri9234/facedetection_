# facedetection_
This project implements a real-time face detection and recognition system using OpenCV and SQLite. The system captures video from a webcam, detects faces, and recognizes known users based on previously trained data.
Key Features:

Face Detection: Utilizes Haar Cascades to detect faces in real-time.
Face Recognition: Employs the LBPH algorithm for accurate face recognition.
Database Integration: Uses SQLite to store and manage user profiles, ensuring secure and efficient data handling.
Setup and Usage:

Dependencies: List of required libraries and how to install them.
Database Initialization: Instructions to set up the SQLite database.
Running the Application: Step-by-step guide to run the face detection and recognition system.
